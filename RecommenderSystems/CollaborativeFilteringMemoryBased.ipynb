    "Recommender systems are one of the most successful and widespread application of machine learning technologies in industry. The ability to suggest products with most appealing factor to each consumer type of your clients base is trivial not only to keep your clients engaged, but to atract new costumers. The business model and success of big companys like Netflix, Amazon, Steam, Spotify, YouTube and many others, revolves around the potency of their *Recommender Systems*.\n",

    "A recommender system deals with the task of predict the degree of similarity between items (movies, songs, clothing, shoes, etc) or users in a database. Based on these similarities the system can provide personalized *recommendations* of items for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, recommender systems can be classified into 3 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collaborative Filtering based:** These systems predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item based on past user ratings or preferences. No item metadata is required, in contrast to its content-based counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Content-based Filtering:** These systems predict the item rating or user preference based on item metadata (genre, director, description, actors, color, etc) and user preferences and history. These systems dependes highly on item metadata.\n",

    "* **Hybrid systems:** These systems try to leverage the best of both worlds and constitutes a wide range of state-of-art techniques in industry. These are complex systems, usually made of multiple smaller subsystems.\n",

    "\n",
    "What can we say about those recommendations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some recommendations are pretty good. For example, \"Batman Returns\" is similar to other Batman movies, that's for sure. \"The Lion King\" is similar to \"Aladdin\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\" (Disney movies). \"Star Wars\" is similar to other Star Wars movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of them does not make much sense. \"Toy Story\" does not seems so similar to \"The Rock\" and \"Mission: Impossible\" to me. \"The Lion King\" is not so similar to \"Jurassic Park\" too, aside that both have animals as their main feature. And I certainly cannot understand the similarity between \"The Godfather\" movies with \"Star Wars\" movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal conclusions aside, there are some well-known advantages of memory-based Collaborative Filtering systems in literature. Some of them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Explainability of the results:** which is an important aspect of recommendations systems;\n",
    "* **Easy of creation and use:** all methodology is purely based in manipulations of the interactions matrix;\n",
    "* **Content-independence of the items being recommended:** no descriptions, nor genre definitions, nor color definitions, nor size definition, etc. No metadata at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "But nothing in this world is perfect, and this approach suffers from disadvantages too. Some of them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance decreases when data gets more sparse:** which occurs frequently with web-related items;\n",
    "* **Adding new items becomes more complicated:** since the data sctructures representations as an interactions matrix relies on a specific *vector space*, adding new items requires inclusion of the new item and the re-insertion of all elements in the structure.\n",
    "* **Recommendations tend to be already popular:** items from the so-called [long-tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail) section might get ignored."
